# ``LiquidGlass``

A lightweight SwiftUI library for creating glass effects.

## Overview

LiquidGlass makes it easy to add glass effects to your SwiftUI views. It uses system APIs when available (Platform 26+) and provides a pure SwiftUI fallback for older platforms. The library is optimized for performance and appearance, including automatic dark mode adaptation.
